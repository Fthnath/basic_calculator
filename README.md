# ðŸ§® Basic Calculator (Python)

This is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The program:
1. Prompts the user to input two numbers.
2. Asks the user to select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
3. Performs the operation and displays the result.

### âœ… Example

```bash
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
